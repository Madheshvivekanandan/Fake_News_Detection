# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using a **Logistic Regression model** trained on a dataset from Kaggle. The model was trained after preprocessing the dataset and vectorizing the text using **TF-IDF**. A **Streamlit web app** was developed to allow users to input news content and get real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle:  
[Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainpooja/fake-news-detection/data?select=True.csv)

### Dataset Features:
- **Text**: The news article content  
- **Label**: Indicates whether the news is fake (1) or real (0)  

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)  
- **Pickle** (Model Saving & Loading)  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
